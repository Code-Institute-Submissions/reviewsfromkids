# Testing
Back to the [README](https://github.com/ChiefChingu/reviewsfromkids/blob/master/README.md).

First I tested the project with the validators for css, markup, JS and Python. Then I manually tested all user stories and features (if relevant). All results are displayed below.

## W3C CSS Validation Service
Validator on [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) gave no errors.

Note: Bootstrap CSS has not been validated.

## W3C Markup Validation Service
Validator on [https://validator.w3.org/nu/](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) gave no errors.

## JSHint
Only one remark: undefined variable in the file "PostLoad.js". This relates to the $ sign of jQuery code and is therefore ignored.

## Pep8
If you run the code through a PEP8 checker, you will see E501 warnings: line too long.

Conform the instructions on the [offical Django site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/) I left these in and only wrapped the code to respect the limit of 119 characters.

"An exception to PEP 8 is our rules on line lengths. Donâ€™t limit lines of code to 79 characters if it means the code looks significantly uglier or is harder to read. We allow up to 119 characters as this is the width of GitHub code review; anything longer requires horizontal scrolling which makes review more difficult. This check is included when you run flake8. Documentation, comments, and docstrings should be wrapped at 79 characters, even though PEP 8 suggests 72."

## User stories
Each user story is tested thoroughly. All steps are taken in the main browsers at 3 different viewports: mobile (including tablet) and desktop.
Some user stories have variations based on the completeness of the profile. Profile completeness levels:

- Lvl-0: user has created an account and with that a userprofile. No information except the username.
- Lvl-1: all of lvl-0 + user has filled in first name, last name, date of birth and gender.
- Lvl-2: all of lvl-1 + user has either selected hobbies or sports.
- Lvl-3: all of lvl-2 + user has both selected hobbies and sports.
